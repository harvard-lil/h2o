    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>H2O is committed to preserving your privacy. This privacy policy discloses how H2O uses and collects information through the H2O Services. H2O reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at anytime at its discretion. If H2O does make changes to this privacy policy, H2O will update this page accordingly. Please check this page periodically for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this privacy policy, terms used in this privacy policy have the same meanings as in the <%= link_to 'Terms of Service', page_path('terms-of-service') %>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information that H2O Collects</h2>
    <h3>a. Usage Data</h3>

    <p>As with most services, H2O may collect certain information when you use the H2O Services, even when you are not logged in. H2O collects this information when you access the H2O Services, including when you set up accounts, upload information, or browse, read, or download information from the H2O Services. This information may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, URL request, browser type, and the date and time of a request. H2O may use cookies or other automated mechanisms to collect this information and may collect this information on an aggregate or individual basis. Cookies are small text files that the H2O Services can send to your browser for storage on your computer. They make use of the Site easier by saving your status and preferences and refreshing them every time you use the Site. For instance, to facilitate registration and login functions, H2O may use cookies to recognize when you return to the Site so that you do not have to resubmit your logon credentials. In order to clear this logon information, for example if using a public terminal, you should log out of your account. While many browsers allow you to change your settings in order to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent, it is recommended that you leave cookies enabled, as disabling cookies will prevent you from logging into your account and interfere with some functionality of the H2O Services.</p>

    <h3>b. Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

    <p>In order to access certain parts of the H2O Services, H2O may require you to provide personally identifiable information, such as your email address, in order to create an account and access certain parts of the H2O Services. H2O uses this information to manage your account, communicate with you, and provide the H2O Services to you. H2O will not collect any personally identifiable information from your use of the H2O Services unless you choose to provide it by registering for an account or otherwise posting, sending or uploading the information to the H2O Services.</p>

    <h3>c. User Content that You Post to the H2O Services</h3>

    <p>You may also post User Content to the H2O Services at your discretion. User Content that you post or provide through the H2O Services will be publicly available, viewable to other Users, and may appear in search results on third-party search engines. H2O recommends that you do not post any personally identifiable information, such as your address, social security number or other personal information, as that information may be publicly displayed and seen by other Users.</p>

    <h2>2. How H2O Uses the Information It Collects</h2>

    <p>H2O uses the information that it collects to deliver and improve the H2O Services, administer mailing lists and online communities, and other activities related to the provision of the H2O Services. H2O may publish or make certain information collected through the H2O Services publicly available, but will not make your email or other personally identifiable information public without your consent. H2O may retain all data and content collected through the H2O Services for restorative, archival, or research purposes. Editing or deleting your User Content will alter the public availability of the User Content, but may not permanently delete the content from the H2O Services.</p>

    <h2>3. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>

    <p>H2O may share the information it collects with its third-party service providers or partners for research purposes or as necessary to provide or improve the H2O Services. In addition, although H2O will not publicly share personally identifiable information unless you choose to make that information public, H2O may publicly share aggregated data or statistics related to the H2O Services that may include anonymized User information or usage statistics. In the event that H2O is required by law to disclose any information related to your account, H2O will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of the request by email, unless H2O is prohibited by law or government order from doing so.</p>


    <h2>4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>

    <p>The H2O Services are intended for adults. H2O will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If H2O discovers it has collected personally identifying information from a child under the age of 13, H2O will delete this information from its records as soon as possible.

    <p>H2O has taken efforts to put security measures in place to protect information and data that is collected through the H2O Services. However, H2O cannot guarantee or warrant that any information collected through the H2O Services will remain confidential, and many functions of the H2O Services are intended to make information and content publicly available.
