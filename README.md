## Development

We support local development with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Hosts Setup

Add the following to `/etc/hosts`:

    127.0.0.1 opencasebook.test opencasebook.minio.test

### Spin up some containers

Start up the Docker containers in the background:

    $ docker-compose up -d

The first time this runs it will build the Docker images, which
may take several minutes. (After the first time, it should only take
1-3 seconds.)

If the H2O team has provided you with a pg_dump file, seed the database with data:

    $ bash docker/init.sh -f ~/database.dump

Then log into the main Docker container:

    $ docker-compose exec web bash

(Commands from here on out that start with `#` are being run in Docker.)

### Run Django

You should now have a working installation of H2O!

Spin up the development server...

    # fab run
    or, with [Django Debug Toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) enabled,
    # fab run:debug_toolbar=True

...and visit http://opencasebook.test:8000

### Frontend assets

Frontend assets live in `frontend/` and are compiled with vue-cli. If you want to run frontend assets:

Install requirements:

    # npm install

Run the development server with hot-reloading vue-cli pipeline:

    # fab run_frontend
    or, with [Django Debug Toolbar](https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) enabled,
    # fab run_frontend:debug_toolbar=True

After making changes to frontend/, compile new assets:

    # npm run build

(Or if you run_frontend and don't end up changing anything, then instead of running `npm run build` afterward
you can just revert the changes to `webpack-stats.json`)

### Stop

When you are finished, spin down Docker containers by running:

    $ docker-compose down

Your database will persist and will load automatically the next time you run `docker-compose up -d`.

Or, you can clean up everything Docker-related, so you can start fresh, as with a new installation:

    $ bash docker/clean.sh


## Testing

### Test Commands

1. `pytest` runs python tests
1. `pytest -n auto` runs python tests with concurrency (faster, same config as CI)
1. `flake8` runs python lints
1. `npm run test` runs javascript tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)
1. `npm run lint` runs javascript lints

### Coverage

Coverage will be generated automatically for all manually-run tests.

## Migrations

We use standard Django migrations.
