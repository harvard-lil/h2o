## [Live version](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/)

## Development

> TODO: These instructions are incomplete for dev platforms other than OS X, and probably lack steps needed on a fresh machine.

### Set up RVM

1. Install RVM (if missing) with `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --auto-dotfiles`, then `source ~/.bash_profile` etc.
2. Install the project Ruby version (e.g. `rvm install $(<.ruby-version)`)
2. `cd` into the h2o directory (or `cd .` if already there) to create the gemset.

### Install gems with Bundler

1. `gem install bundler && bundle install`
2. (If Bundler complains about missing library dependencies, install them and `bundle install` until it succeeds.)

### Set up the Postgres database

1. Install postgres (if missing) with e.g. `brew install postgres` for OS X.
3. Create and initialize the database with `rake db:setup` (or `rake db:reset`)

> TODO: Populate `seeds.rb`. Without certain seed data the app might still not be fully working.

### Run Guard

1. Run `guard`. It will take several seconds to:
2. Make sure the bundle is up-to-date;
2. Start the dev/test Solr server;
3. Load Spring for fast `rails`/`rake` commands;
4. And finally boot Rails.
3. (Optionally, install a notifier such as Growl or `brew install terminal-notifier` for Guard notifications.)
4. Guard will now be watching the project for changes and will restart Spring/Rails when needed. This can also be done from the guard command line, e.g. `reload rails`.
5. When finished, type `exit` to shut everything down and close Guard.

### Configure the local domain

The dev server is now accessible at http://localhost:8000, but it likely won't look quite right because Typekit isn't loading. To fix:

1. e.g. OS X: `echo 127.0.0.1 h2o.murk.law.harvard.edu | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`
2. Go to [http://h2o.murk.law.harvard.edu:8000](http://h2o.murk.law.harvard.edu:8000)

> TODO: Change this to something more like `h2o.local` and add that to Typekit :)

## Testing

### Test design

Since we're going to be heavily refactoring and likely removing a lot of code, the focus for now will be on high-level feature tests which will survive that. [cases_test.rb](test/features/cases_test.rb) is an example of the test pattern using Minitest and Capybara which exercises the full stack from a user's point of view.

### Javascript

Test scenarios marked with `js: true` will be run in a headless WebKit environment via Poltergeist. This requires the PhantomJS binary to be installed, e.g. `brew install phantomjs`. Headless tests are significantly slower than static tests, so prefer to avoid writing tests (and features!) that require JS when possible.

Guard will not automatically run these tests. This is less than ideal when working on a client-side feature, so you can mark a given test with `focus: true` to force Guard to run it. If no JS tests are enabled, PhantomJS will not boot, speeding up the whole test suite considerably.

### Guard testing

Guard will automatically run all static tests after booting Rails and  again after any test or app file is edited. By default, Guard _won't_ run any tests that require JS, since they're so much slower. You can run those tests manually:

1. `bin/rake test:all` runs all tests, including JS tests.
1. `bin/rake test test/features/cases_test.rb` runs the case feature test, and so on, including JS tests.

### Coverage

1. `bin/rake test:coverage` will run all tests and generate a coverage report in `coverage/index.html`.

> TODO: When coverage is a bit higher, add a git commit hook which runs the coverage report and fails if under some value.
