    appeal from the Court of Chancery involves a class action brought by shareholders
    of the defendant Trans Union Corporation (&quot;Trans Union&quot; or &quot;the
    Company&quot;), originally seeking rescission of a cash-out merger of Trans Union
    into the defendant New T Company (&quot;New T&quot;), a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of the defendant, Marmon Group, Inc. (&quot;Marmon&quot;). Alternate relief in
    the form of damages is sought against the defendant members of the Board of Directors
    of Trans Union, [864] New T, and Jay A. Pritzker and Robert A. Pritzker, owners
    of Marmon.<sup><a href=\"#[1]\" name=\"r[1]\">[1]</a></sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>----------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a
    href=\"#r[1]\" name=\"[1]\">[1]</a> The plaintiff, Alden Smith, originally sought
    to enjoin the merger; but, following extensive discovery, the Trial Court denied
    the plaintiff&#39;s motion for preliminary injunction by unreported letter opinion
    dated February 3, 1981. On February 10, 1981, the proposed merger was approved
    by Trans Union&#39;s stockholders at a special meeting and the merger became effective
    on that date. Thereafter, John W. Gosselin was permitted to intervene as an additional
    plaintiff; and Smith and Gosselin were certified as representing a class consisting
    of all persons, other than defendants, who held shares of Trans Union common stock
    on all relevant dates. At the time of the merger, Smith owned 54,000 shares of
    Trans Union stock, Gosselin owned 23,600 shares, and members of Gosselin&#39;s
    family owned 20,000 shares.</p>\r\n"
