  title: Smith v. Van Gorkom
  headnote: "<p>This is the one case where Delaware courts imposed monetary liability
    on disinterested directors for breach of the duty of care. It caused a storm.
    Liability insurance rates for directors skyrocketed. The Delaware legislature
    intervened by enacting&nbsp;DGCL&nbsp;102(b)(7), which allows exculpatory charter
    provisions to eliminate damages for breaches of the duty of care (see next section).
    Such charter provisions are now standard. Even without them, however, it is unlikely
    that a Delaware court would impose liability on these facts today. The courts
    seem to have retrenched &mdash; not in their doctrine but in how they apply it.&nbsp;<em>\uFEFFCf.
    Disney</em>\uFEFF below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should, therefore, read the case not
    as an exemplary application&nbsp;of the duty of care, but as a policy experiment:
    why is the corporate world so opposed to monetary damages on these facts?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Background:
    the Acquisition Process&nbsp;</strong>(more in M&amp;A,&nbsp;<em>infra</em>)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The
    case involves the acquisition of the Trans Union Corporation by Marmon Group,
    Inc. As is typical, the acquisition is&nbsp;structured as a merger. The acquired
    corporation (the &ldquo;target&rdquo;) merges with the acquiror (the &ldquo;buyer&rdquo;)
    or one of the buyer&#39;s subsidiaries. In the merger, shares in the target are
    extinguished. In exchange, target shareholders receive cash or other consideration
    (usually shares in the buyer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under most U.S. statutes such as&nbsp;DGCL&nbsp;251,
    the merger generally requires a merger agreement between the buyer and the target
    to be approved by the boards and a majority of the shareholders of each corporation.
    <p>This entails two important consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the board controls
    the process because only the board can have the corporation enter into the merger
    agreement. <p>This is one example of why it is at least misleading to call shareholders
    the &ldquo;owners of the corporation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two, in public corporations,
    the requirement of shareholder approval means that several months will pass between
    signing the merger agreement and completion of the merger. <p>This is the time it
    takes to convene the shareholder meeting and solicit proxies in accordance with
    the applicable corporate law and&nbsp;SEC&nbsp;proxy rules. Of course, many things
    can happen during this time. In particular, other potential buyers may appear
    on the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Questions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1.
    According to the majority opinion, what did the directors do wrong? In other words,
    what should the directors have done differently? Why did the business judgment
    rule not apply?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. What are the dissenters&rsquo; counter-arguments?<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\n3. How do you think directors in other companies reacted to this
    decision &mdash; what, if anything, did they most likely do differently after
    Van Gorkom?</blockquote>\r\n"
