# Django settings used by pytest

# WARNING: this imports from .settings_dev instead of config.settings, meaning it chooses to IGNORE any settings in
# config/settings/settings.py. This is potentially better (in that it doesn't return different results locally than
# it will on CI), but also potentially worse (in that you can't try out settings tweaks in settings.py and run tests
# against them).
