Welcome to H2O!
The H2O platform allows you to make open education resources that are dynamic, easy-to-share, and free for students and everyone else. We’re happy to have you with us as we promote open casebooks and more.

Update your Profile
If you are a professor, fill in your profile information and check the box to be verified. Once confirmed, you’ll have a green check mark next to your name and your casebooks will be surfaced in search results: https://opencasebook.org/accounts/edit/.

Get Started
To jump right into creating a new casebook or resource, log in to H2O and click 'Create Casebook' at the top of the page. We also encourage you to browse our collection of existing casebooks which you can adapt for your own use with our ‘Clone’ feature, instead of starting from scratch: https://opencasebook.org/search/. 
You can find tips for creating your first casebook with our help guides and video tutorials: {{ GUIDE_URL }}. 

Stay Connected
If you are an educator, be sure to sign up for our newsletter (https://opencasebook.org/subscribe) and follow us on Twitter ({{ TWITTER_URL }}). If you want to spread the word about open education resources for law, help us grow the H2O community by telling your colleagues about us, or by sharing out your finished casebooks so folks can see what H2O is all about.
